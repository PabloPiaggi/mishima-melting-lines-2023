# Melting curves of ice polymorphs in the vicinity of the liquid-liquid critical point

### Standard coexistence simulations

We performed standard coexistence simulations of ice IV and ice V to validate the results obtained with biased coexistence and the integration of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.
Results are shown in folders ```IceIV``` and ```IceV```.
The subfolders correspond to simulations at different thermodynamic conditions.
The naming convention is ```Ice(IV/V)/Ice(IV/V)-TEMP-PRESS``` where TEMP and PRESS are the temperature in K and the pressure in bar used for the simulation.
For instance,
* ```IceV/IceV-260.0-2500.0```
* ```IceIV/IceIV-250.0-3500.0/```

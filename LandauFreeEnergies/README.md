# Melting curves of ice polymorphs in the vicinity of the liquid-liquid critical point

We used a Landau model to plot the schematic free energy surfaces shown in Figure 1 of our manuscript.
The model is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook ```Analysis.ipynb``` and plots are also shown in the same notebook.
